About Dolby Atmos Enabled speakers

![30_image_1.png](30_image_1.png) Dolby Atmos Enabled speakers reflect the sound off the ceiling to allow the sound to come from over your head by using a special upwardpointing speaker that is placed on the floor.

You can enjoy the Dolby Atmos 3D sound even in an environment where speakers cannot be installed on the ceiling.

# Tips

0 This unit is compatible with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X which offers an even wider and deeper surround sensation.

0 The "Speaker Virtualizer" must be set to "On" for Dolby Atmos playback with 5.1channel speaker configurations or less. (v p. 155)
0 DTS:X can be selected regardless of the speaker configuration. 0 Use the illustration below as a guide for how high each speaker should be installed. The height does not need to be exactly the same.

## Connecting Speakers

Here we connect the speakers in the room to this unit.

## Before Connecting Speakers Note

0 Disconnect this unit's power plug from the power outlet before connecting the speakers. Also, turn off the subwoofer.

0 Connect so that the speaker cable core wires do not protrude from the speaker terminal. The protection circuit may be activated if the core wires touch the rear panel or if the + and - sides touch each other. ("Protection circuit" (v p. 272))
0 Never touch the speaker terminals while the power cord is connected. Doing so could result in electric shock. When the "Setup Assistant" (page 9 in the separate "Quick Start Guide") is running, follow the instructions in the "Setup Assistant" screen for making connections. (Power is not supplied to the speaker terminals while the "Setup Assistant" is running.)
0 Use speakers with an impedance of 4 - 16 Ω/ohms.

If you set this unit's input source to "Phono" and you accidentally increase the volume without having a turntable connected, you may hear a hum noise from the speakers.

![59_image_0.png](59_image_0.png)

0 The earth terminal (SIGNAL GND) of this unit is not for safety grounding purposes. If this terminal is connected when there is a lot of noise, the noise can be reduced. Note that depending on the turntable, connecting the ground line may have the reverse effect of increasing noise. In this case, it is not necessary to connect the ground line.

## Speakers

The acoustic characteristics of the connected speakers and listening room are measured and the optimum settings are made automatically. This is called
"Audyssey® Setup".

You do not have to perform Audyssey® Setup when you have already performed "Speaker Calibration" in "Setup Assistant".

To set up the speakers manually, use "Manual Setup" on the menu. (v p. 193)

## Audyssey® Setup

To perform measurement, place the Sound calibration microphone in multiple locations all around the listening area. For best results, we recommend you measure in six or more positions, as shown in the illustration (up to eight positions). When measuring the second and subsequent positions, install the Sound calibration microphone within 2 ft (60 cm) of the first measurement position (main listening position).

0 If you perform Audyssey® Setup, Audyssey MultEQ® XT, Audyssey Dynamic EQ®
and Audyssey Dynamic Volume® functions are enabled. (v p. 160)

## O About The Main Listening Position

The main listening position is the position where listeners would normally sit or where one would normally sit alone within the listening environment. Before starting Audyssey® Setup, place the Sound calibration microphone in the main listening position.

Audyssey MultEQ® XT uses the measurements from this position to calculate speaker distance, level, polarity, and the optimum crossover value for the subwoofer.

measurements. Close windows and turn off the power on electronic devices (radios, air conditioners, fluorescent lights, etc.). The measurements could be affected by the sounds emitted by such devices.

0 During the measurement process, place cell phones outside the listening room.

Cell phone signals could disrupt the measurements.

0 Do not stand between the speakers and Sound calibration microphone or allow obstacles in the path while the measurements are being made. Also, install the Sound calibration microphone at least 20 inches (50 cm) away from the wall. Failure to do so will result in inaccurate readings.

0 During the measurement process, audible test tones will come from the speakers and subwoofer(s), but this is part of normal operation. If there is background noise in the room, these test signals will increase in volume.

0 Operating VOLUME d f on the remote control unit or MASTER VOLUME on the main unit during the measurements will cancel the measurements.

0 Measurement cannot be performed when headphones are connected. Unplug the headphones before performing Audyssey® Setup.

## About Hdmi

HDMI is an abbreviation of High-Definition Multimedia Interface, which is an AV digital interface that can be connected to a TV or amplifier. With the HDMI connection, high definition video and high quality audio formats adopted by Blu-ray Disc players (Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD, DTS-HD Master Audio) can be transmitted, which is not possible with the analog video transmission. Furthermore, in the HDMI connection, audio and video signals can be transmitted through a single HDMI cable, while in conventional connections it is necessary to provide audio and video cables separately for connection between devices. This allows you to simplify the wiring configuration that tends to be quite complex in a home theater system. This unit supports the following HDMI functions.

## 0 Deep Color

An imaging technology supported by HDMI. Unlike RGB or YCbCr, which uses 8 bits (256 shades) per color, it can use 10 bits (1024 shades), 12 bits (4096 shades), or 16 bits (65536 shades) to produce colors in higher definition. Both devices linked via HDMI must support Deep Color.

## 0 X.V.Color

This function lets HDTVs display colors more accurately. It enables display with natural, vivid colors. "x.v.Color" is trademark of Sony Corporation.

## Explanation Of Terms O Audyssey Audyssey Dynamic Eq®

Audyssey Dynamic EQ® solves the problem of deteriorating sound quality as volume is decreased by taking into account human perception and room acoustics.

Audyssey Dynamic EQ® works in tandem with Audyssey MultEQ® XT to provide well-balanced sound for every listener at any volume level.

## Audyssey Dynamic Volume®

Dynamic Volume solves the problem of large variations in volume level between television programs, commercials, and between the soft and loud passages of movies. Audyssey Dynamic EQ® is integrated into Dynamic Volume so that as the playback volume is adjusted automatically, the perceived bass response, tonal balance, surround impression, and dialog clarity remain the same.

## O Dolby Dolby Atmos

Introduced first in the cinema, Dolby Atmos brings a revolutionary sense of dimension and immersion to the Home Theater experience. Dolby Atmos is an adaptable and scalable object based format that reproduces audio as independent sounds (or objects) that can be accurately positioned and move dynamically throughout the 3 dimensional listening space during playback. A key ingredient of Dolby Atmos is the introduction of a height plane of sound above the listener.

## Dolby Atmos Stream

Dolby Atmos content will be delivered to your Dolby Atmos Enabled AV receiver via Dolby Digital Plus or Dolby TrueHD on Blu-ray Disc, downloadable files and streaming media. A Dolby Atmos stream contains special metadata that describes the positioning of sounds within the room. This object audio data is decoded by a Dolby Atmos AV receiver and scaled for optimum playback through Home Theater speaker systems of every size and configuration.

![264_Image_2.Png](264_Image_2.Png)

![264_Image_5.Png](264_Image_5.Png)

Dolby Digital is a multi-channel digital signal format developed by Dolby Laboratories. A total of 5.1-channels are played: 3 front channels ("FL", "FR" and "C"), 2 surround channels ("SL" and "SR") and the "LFE" channel for low frequency effects. Because of this, there is no crosstalk between channels and a realistic sound field with a "three-dimensional" feeling (sense of distance, movement and positioning) is achieved. This delivers a thrilling surround sound experience in the home.

## Dolby Digital Plus

Dolby Digital Plus is an improved Dolby Digital signal format that is compatible with up to 7.1-channels of discrete digital sound and also improves sound quality thanks to extra data bit rate performance. It is upwardly compatible with conventional Dolby Digital, so it offers greater flexibility in response to the source signal and the conditions of the playback device.

## Dolby Surround

## Dolby Speaker Technology (Dolby Atmos Enabled Speakers)

A convenient alternative to speakers built into the ceiling, Dolby Atmos Enabled speakers employ the ceiling above you as a reflective surface for reproducing audio in the height plane above the listener. These speakers feature a unique upward firing driver and special signal processing. These features can be built into a conventional speaker or standalone speaker module. The features minimally impact the overall speaker footprint while providing an immersive listening experience during Dolby Atmos and Dolby Surround playback.

## Dolby Truehd

Dolby TrueHD is a high definition audio technology developed by Dolby Laboratories, using lossless coding technology to faithfully reproduce the sound of the studio master. This format provides the facility to support up to 8 audio channels with a sampling frequency of 96 kHz/24 bit resolution and up to 6 audio channels with a sampling frequency of 192 kHz/24 bit resolution.

![265_Image_5.Png](265_Image_5.Png)

![265_Image_6.Png](265_Image_6.Png)

Dolby Atmos height virtualization is a digital signal processing solution that

![265_image_7.png](265_image_7.png)

![265_image_10.png](265_image_10.png) leverages Dolby's deep understanding of human audio perception to create the sensation of overhead sound from the listener-level speakers. This signal processing applies height-cue filters to overhead audio components contained within the audio signal before they are mixed into the listener-level speakers.

These filters simulate the natural spectral cues imparted by our ears to sounds that originate from overhead. For stereo and 3.1-channel speaker configuration, Dolby Atmos height virtualization is combined with surround virtualization to create an enveloping 360-degree audio minus the speakers that would ordinarily be employed behind or to the side of the listener.

## Network Names (Ssid: Service Set Identifier)

When forming wireless LAN networks, groups are formed to prevent interference, data theft, etc. These groups are based on "SSID (network names)". For enhanced security, a WEP key is set so that communication is unavailable unless both the "SSID" and the WEP key match. This is suitable for constructing a simplified network.
