### Who am I?

Hi there, I am Adithya S K, a 20-year-old AI enthusiast. I have been working with AI systems for over a year now, engaging in various projects from training and finetuning models (LLMs) to implementing sophosticated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines in production.&#x20;

**I've often been asked about the best free resources to get started with AI, and I found it challenging to give a definitive answer.**

With AI Engineering Academy, I aim to:

1. Provide a structured and well-thought-out path for beginners in AI.
2. Emphasize applying AI knowledge by creating projects.

### What to Expect

Each chapter in AI Engineering Academy will include:

* **Video Lessons:** A 5 to 15-minute video covering code and concept overviews, answering three main questions:
  * **Why you should learn it:** Understanding the importance and relevance of the topic.
  * **How it will be useful:** Exploring practical applications and benefits.
  * **What is the most optimal way to implement it:** Learning best practices and efficient implementation techniques.
* **Code Examples:** The most updated and relevant code examples to help you grasp the concepts and apply them in real-world scenarios.
* **Hands-on Notebooks/Scripts:** Practical notebooks and scripts to implement the chapter topics, providing an interactive and engaging learning experience.
* **Additional Resources:** Links to supplementary materials for deeper dives into the topics, providing a comprehensive learning experience.
